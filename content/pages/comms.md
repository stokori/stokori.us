Title: Commissions & ToS
Slug: commissions

###Digital Painting

Standard pricing for a single full body digital painting of a character is $70. Portraits/bust shots run for around $40. Prices extrapolate from there based on the complexity of the design, detail of the background, and the number of characters. I accept both visual and written descriptions for characters, and specialize in drawing complex scenes that let me take full advantage of color, light, and shadow.

###Website Creation & Consulting

I also offer website commissions. I love making websites for other artists! I also offer consulting if you'd like a second opinion on your work. Please contact me for my rates.

Send me a message either on here, on twitter (@stokori), or via email (kazi@stokori.us) for a specific quote on any of the above! I look forward to doing business with you!

###Terms of Service

 * I reserve the right to deny a commission for any reason whatsoever.
 * I will send an update for the initial sketch, final sketch, and colored stages. You are allowed two revisions at each stage before you accrue additional charges.
 *  Minor changes may be made to the final rendered product, but I reserve the right to charge additional for anything more than small tweaks.
 * I will happily draw most things for you! Humans, anthropomorphic animals, robots – you name it. Gore, blood, artistic nudity, and other non-sexual NSFW will likely be accepted.
 * Other NSFW commissions will be accepted on a case-by-case basis and will not be posted publicly.
 * This is a problem I have run into in the past -- if I draw your character, and it’s a fox/wolf/dingo/whatever, I will draw it like that species. That may look different than what you’re used to because many furry artists draw all canids/felids the same. Please do not mistake this accuracy for me getting your design wrong.
