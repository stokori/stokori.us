### <div id="artSection">Digital Painting</div> ###

* **A single full body digital painting of a character** starts at $70. 
* **Portraits/bust shots** start at $50. 
* **Icons** are $25 flat.
* **In-stream commissions** are always **discounted:** Icons are $20 flat, Busts start $40, and fullbodies start at 60$.

Prices extrapolate from there based on the complexity of the design, detail of the background, and the number of characters. (With the exception of icons, which are always the same price).

I accept both visual and written descriptions for characters, and specialize in drawing complex scenes that let me take full advantage of color, light, and shadow.

Please see [here](http://www.stokori.us/art/) for examples of my work!

If you commission a either a fullbody character or large landscape painting for me, you can also **buy a handmade sketchbook with the art on it!**

Here's an example of what they look like! And here's a <a href="https://twitter.com/stokori/status/927316541577859078)">video of them</a> in action.</div>

They are 1/2 letter paper sized, archival quality, and perfect bound with high quality book glue. I usually use 110 lb heavyweight cardstock (works well for ink & light wet media like markers), but I am capable of making them with whatever paper you would prefer!
Depending on the price of the paper you would like, they are $30 for the first one and then $20 after. You're free to re-order more at any time.

## <div id="websiteSection"> Website Creation & Consulting </div> ##

I also offer website commissions. I love making websites for other artists, especially if you're just getting started! I also provide hosting for your website with no contract at rates cheaper than most big-name hosts, including support in the case something ever breaks.

If you'd just like advice on how to improve your existing website, I also offer consulting. Please contact me for my rates.

Send me a message either on twitter (@stokori), or via email (kazi@stokori.us) for a specific quote on any of the above! I look forward to doing business with you!

### <div id="tos">Terms of Service</div> ###

 * I reserve the right to deny a commission for any reason whatsoever.
 * I will send an update for the initial sketch, final sketch, and colored stages. You are allowed two revisions at each stage before you accrue additional charges.
 * In-stream commissions will be completed in-stream -- you will be able to provide feedback while the drawing is being made, and the expectation is that you will use the stream to voice any concerns. I will not make changes after it is complete.
 * In the event that I can not complete an in-stream commission live, you will be allowed the typical two revisions at each stage like a normal commission.
 * Minor changes may be made to the final rendered product, but I reserve the right to charge additional for anything more than small tweaks.
 * I will happily draw most things for you! Humans, anthropomorphic animals, robots – you name it. Gore, blood, artistic nudity, and other non-sexual NSFW will likely be accepted.
 * Other NSFW commissions will be accepted on a case-by-case basis and will not be posted publicly.
 * This is a problem I have run into in the past -- if I draw your character, and it’s a fox/wolf/dingo/whatever, I will draw it like that species. That may look different than what you’re used to because many furry artists draw all canids/felids the same. Please do not mistake this accuracy for me getting your design wrong.
