Title: About

<img class="float-left" src="/thumbs/square/avatar1.png">

I’m Stokori, or Kazimir Fodor! Among many other things, I'm a multimedia artist and developer. I like birds, coffee, and breaking computers. 

I’m double majoring in Computer Science and Studio Art (Integrated Media emphasis) at St. Cloud State University. I’ve been in school long enough that any reasonable person would’ve graduated by now, and yet still plan on graduate school.

I like to tell stories with my art. Practically everything I make will end up being narrative in some way. I also love experimenting, so my art tends to be kind of eclectic—I'll try basically any form of art at least once.

I have a pet pigeon, Corbin, and they are the best bird ever. I will talk to you about them. All day.

If you'd like to get a hold of me, the most reliable way is to contact me via [twitter](http://twitter.com/stokori) or email(kazi@stokori.us).
