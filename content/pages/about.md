Title: About

<img class="float-left" src="/thumbs/square/avatar1.png">

Kazimir "Stokori" Fodor is a web developer, worldbuilder, pigeon wrangler, and multimedia artist. They are currently pursuing a B.A. in Studio Art (Integrated Media emphasis) from St. Cloud State University, and have work experience in .NET, Python, Javascript, and PHP. They occasionally participate in game jams such as Ludum Dare and Global Game Jam, and are a volunteer coder for the yearly event [Art Fight](https://artfight.net/).

Their art tends to tell stories, creating narratives with a variety of mediums. They are fascinated with the idea of opposites -- art vs. science, man vs. woman, and nature vs. technology -- and enjoy to tell stories of reconciling the two.

They love birds and coffee, and have a pet pigeon (Corbin) and a blue tongued skink (Chirico).
