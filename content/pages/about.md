Title: About

<img class="float-left" src="/thumbs/square/avatar1.png">

Kazimir "Stokori" Fodor, among many other things, is a developer and multimedia artist. They like birds, coffee, and breaking computers. 

They currently attend St. Cloud State University and are double majoring in Computer Science and Studio Art (Integrated Media emphasis). They've been in school long enough that any reasonable person wouldâ€™ve graduated by now.

Their art tends to tell stories, creating narratives with a variety of mediums. They are fascinated with the idea of opposites -- art vs. science, man vs. woman, and nature vs. technology -- and enjoy to tell stories of reconciling the two.

They have a pet pigeon, Corbin, and they are the best bird ever. They will talk to you about them. All day. They also have a lizard, Chirico, but he doesn't get out much.

If you'd like to get a hold of them, the most reliable way is to contact them via [twitter](http://twitter.com/stokori) or email(kazi@stokori.us).
