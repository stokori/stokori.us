Title: About

I’m Kazimir Fodor! Among many other things, I'm a multimedia artist. I’m double majoring in Computer Science and Studio Art (Integrated Media emphasis) at St. Cloud State University. I’ve been in school long enough that any reasonable person would’ve graduated by now, but still plan on attending graduate school to pursue something like visualization engineering. Apparently, I really like school.

Along with making art, I also write, worldbuild, and code. I love doing pretty much anything that lets me combine my technical and art skills in some way. I also tend to update things very sporadically. Oops.

If you'd like to get a hold of me, the most reliable way is to contact me via [twitter](http://twitter.com/stokori) or email(stokoriel[at]gmail[dot]com). Does breaking up emails like that even work anymore? I have no idea.
