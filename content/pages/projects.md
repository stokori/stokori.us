Title: Projects

I work on a lot of half-finished interactive projects when I can. Here's some of the notable ones.

### [New World of Darkness NPC Generator](https://stokori.github.io/nwodnpcgen/) ###
I run a lot of tabletop games, notably World of Darkness, and made this (entirely too ornate) thing in JQuery to help me generate NPCs on the fly.

### [Mapkov](https://github.com/stokori/mapkov) ###
An experiment in NPL (natural language processing). It builds a markov frequency table from a block of text, then uses the table to create a field of colored tiles based on the patterns in the text.

### [Deconstruction](https://stokori.github.io/deconstruction/) ###
An interactive art piece created for Combined Media. The goal was to explore the concept of site-specificity in an online and real world context.
